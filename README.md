# SteamTradeHandler 

This repository automates Steam trading processes. It provides methods to log in to Steam, manage encrypted credentials, and handle trade offers. 
This project is designed as a helper for automating Steam trades, including accepting incoming offers with optional filters (e.g., gifts only).

**This is an older project, so the code may be messy and lacks full documentationâ€”but it was a valuable learning experience in automating Steam trading processes.**

## Key Features:
- **Automated Steam Trading**: Fetch, accept, and manage Steam trade offers.
